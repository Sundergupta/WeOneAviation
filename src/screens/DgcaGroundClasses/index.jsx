                    DGCA Ground Classes are where students prepare for the DGCA exams. It’s similar to regular coaching institutes like IIT or MBBS coaching — the only difference is that here you’ll master all DGCA subjects required to obtain a Commercial Pilot License (CPL).

                    DGCA Ground Classes are classes where students prepare themselves for the DGCA exam. It’s a normal coaching class, like IIT and MBBS coaching classes. The only difference is that after taking DGCA ground classes, you will master the DGCA exam, which is required to obtain a pilot license.

                <h2>What Is DGCA?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is the main government body that controls and regulates all aviation-related activities in India. It makes rules for flying, conducts DGCA exams, and issues pilot licenses. To become a pilot, you must follow DGCA regulations and clear DGCA exams.
                </p>

                <h2>What Does DGCA Do?</h2>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Ensures Safety:</strong> Makes sure all aircraft, airports, and airlines follow safety standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Approves Flying Schools:</strong> Only DGCA-approved schools can train pilots in India.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conducts Exams:</strong> Organizes theory exams (called DGCA Ground Exams) for student pilots.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Are DGCA Ground Classes Important for Pilot Training?</h2>
                <p>
                    DGCA Ground Classes are the first step toward becoming a pilot. If your dream is to become a pilot, you must clear the DGCA exams — and to do that, these classes are essential.
